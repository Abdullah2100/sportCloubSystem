<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This project is about a sport club system. I built this project to help anyone who wants to have a free sport club system.
This project has many sections like people, members, coaches, employees, member subscriptions, and coach training. The structure of this project follows the 3-Tier Application Architecture.
The data layer ensures integrity with the database, and the business layer handles the connection between the app UI and the data layer.
When the app starts, it requires login functionality. You have to disable it in the code, then run the app. The UI may not be perfect, but the functionality is smooth.
